//A quick guide for setting up and configuring express - session middleware.

const express = require("express");

// Sessions can be stored server-side (ex: user auth) or client-side
// (ex: shopping cart). express-session saves sessions in a store, and
// NOT in a cookie. To store sessions in a cookie, use cookie-session.
const session = require("express-session");

// The default in-memory store is not production-ready because it leaks
// memory and doesn't scale beyond once process. For production, we need
// a session store, like Redis, which we can wire up with connect-redis.
const RedisStore = require("connect-redis")(session);

const app = express();

// Redis is a key-value NoSQL data store. It's perfect for sessions,
// because they can be serialized to JSON and stored temporarily using
// SETEX to auto-expire (i.e. auto-remove) after maxAge in seconds.

  host: "localhost",
  port: 6379,

    // makes no sense to save empty sessions for unauthenticated requests,
    // because they are not associated with any valuable data yet, and would
    // waste storage. We'll only save the new session once the user logs in.
    saveUninitialized: false,

    // Whether to force-save the session back to the store, even if it wasn't
    // modified during the request. Default is true (deprecated). We don't

    // Whether to force-set a session ID cookie on every response. Default is
    // false. Enable this if you want to prolong session lifetime while the user
    // is still browsing the site. Beware that the module doesn't have an absolute
    // timeout option, so you'd need to handle indefinite sessions manually.

    // to validate the cookie against any tampering client-side.
